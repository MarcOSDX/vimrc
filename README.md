# About

My minimal vim configuration, this configuration is not intended to be adapted for all setups because I install plugins that require complex installations, so I do not recommend using it unless you want to take it as a template for your own configurations.

## Requirements

* vim 8.1+
* git 2.24.3+
* python 3.8.2+

## Gettings vim configuration

```bash
user@localhost:~> git clone --recursive https://github.com/marcos-roropeza/vimrc ~/.vim
```
